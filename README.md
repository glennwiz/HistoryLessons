Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 â€“ c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer scientist.
He is best known for creating the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson, the Unix operating system and B programming language.
Ritchie and Thompson were awarded the Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. 
Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies System Software Research Department when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr.

Before C cemented its place in history, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others at Bell Labs developed UNIX in the late 1960s and early 1970s. UNIX was revolutionary for its portability, multi-user capabilities, and the introduction of a hierarchical file system. Its design principles continue to influence operating systems today.

Anectode: i did never learn about unix before linux ented my life in the early 90ies, i remember installing slack linux still with floppies and 3.5disks laing around in my nerd cave.
